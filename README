If you want to know how OCaml understands your instructions try this small script.
This script just shows you the signature of instruction - shows the OCaml answer after parsing.

Ver 0.81
Remember to clear the buffer!! (see description below)

Ver 0.79:
Example (returning the first and the last element of the list):
let example a = 
  if (List.length a)=0 then failwith "Empty list!!"
  else List.hd a, List.hd (List.rev a);;
example [1;2;3;4];;

:OCamlSigParseAllF
# let example a  =
  if (List.length a)=0 then failwith \"Error!!!\"
  else List.hd a, List.hd (List.rev a);;
      val example : 'a list -> 'a * 'a = <fun>
# example [1;2;3;4];;
- : int * int = (1, 4)

If you want to use menu type:
:OCamlSigMenu

For parsing one instruction type
:OCamlSigParseInstruction

For parsing whole program:
:OCamlSigParseAll
or (for full parsing information)
:OCamlSigParseF 

To close Status Window:
:OCamlSigStatusWinClose

To open Status Window:
:OCamlSigStatusWinShow

If you want to see the buffer (list of parsed and remembered instructions):
:OCamlSigShowOCamlBuffer

For clearing this buffer:
:OCamlSigClearOCamlBuffer

If the plugin cannot find OCaml edit the plugin file, find this line:
let s:OCamlPath = ""
and set it to path where you have "ocaml" file
